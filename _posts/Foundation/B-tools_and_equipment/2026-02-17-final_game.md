### Scrum master / designer 
This section is to describe what my role was is this project as the scrum master and also the designer. I did things such as planning the theme of our level, sommunicatin gwith other team scrum masters, and helping debug. Below are things that I did the most. 

- communicating with other scrum masters 
- planning theme for our level 
- intiating final steps such as pull requests or merges 
- setting up new repo's 
- assigning roles to team members 
- helping debugging 
- final reviewing code
- testing code 

 ### What roles for this project?
Assigning roles for projects is very important as people have many other specialties than others, when everybody can split up the work the project is much easier. Here are some of the roles I assigned to our team below. 

- code manager for NPC 
- file manager to keep organziation 
- spriter for animation 
- code manager for movement keys 
- code manager for background 
- debugging manager 

### What are some struggles we ran into?
In this project we did not run into as many bugs or problems as we did in the teaching lesson, as we had more experince with the topic. Some prob;ems we ran into this project was thing such as our timline, our NPC was glitching due to wrong animation features, and small bugs here and there such as typos and tiny bugs.
