### roles given to the team 
Roles given to the team:

- code manager for homework
- file manager ( to keep things organized )
- testers ( to ensure everything works )
- making the script 

### problems we ran into 
Some problems we ran into were  a varitey of things, for exmaple towards the beginning of this project we had messed up code runner, by using a different one, which resulted in our code becoming very unstable. Another thing that was hard was debugging small problems such as typos or index.md problems as they were really hard to see when we were looking at only the major chunks. This project was a great learning experience as we learned how to debug faster, and became better teammates.
