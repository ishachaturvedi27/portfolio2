### Accomplishments for team teaching

Team teaching was a project that we had to present to the class, I did my best to maintain organization throughout the timeline, while I also helped the code managers of the project construct the lesson plan and debug any problems we ran into. 

- completed the lesson with code runner 
- completed homework using code runner 
- made a google form for submission
- made a script for during the presentation 
- kanban board for progress

### What roles were used in the game project?
Assigning roles for projects is very important as people have many other specialties than others, when everybody can split up the work the project is much easier. Here are some of the roles I assigned to our team below. 

- code manager for NPC 
- file manager to keep organziation 
- spriter for animation 
- code manager for movement keys 
- code manager for background 
- debugging manager 

### Key accomplishments for the final game project 
Below are some of the accomplishments that we managed to do as a team for this specific project. We learned a lot more about the topic as we had run into similar mistakes in the team teaching lesson, so this project was easier to understand. 

- added a NPC 
- movement keys ( all 8 ways )
- added a new background 
- added extra interactive sprites
- succesfully pull requested and merged
