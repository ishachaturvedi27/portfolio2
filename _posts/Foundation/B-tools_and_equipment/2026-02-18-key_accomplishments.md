### What are some accomplishments for the final game?
In this project we did not run into as many bugs or problems as we did in the teaching lesson, as we had more experince with the topic. Some problems we ran into this project was thing such as our timline, our NPC was glitching due to wrong animation features, and small bugs here and there such as typos and tiny bugs. Our key accomplishments were mainly things such as meeting all the requirments and ensuring that everyone in the team had something to do, which we did better than the last project. We succesfully managed to have a working NPC with interaction, movement, a new background.
