### What are some things I did to keep things organized as scrum master in these projects?
This section is to describe what my role was is this project as the scrum master and a few things that I did by communicating with the team to get everything done as it was expected 

- communicating with other scrum masters 
- daily check-ins with team memebers
- intiating final steps such as pull requests or merges 
- setting up new repo's 
- assigning roles to team members 
- helping debugging 
- final reviewing code
- testing code 
- making planners or kanban boards 

### Here are the key accomplishments from the team teaching project 
In this project we ran into a lot of errors and problems than we thought as it was our first time doing something like this, but in the end we managed to make a clean lesson using code runner, a homework assignment also using code runner, a google form for submission, and pull requests to merge!
### Here is a link to a seperate blog about the team teaching lesson, and how things were operated to make the lesson we presented.

### What are some accomplishments for the final game?
In this project we did not run into as many bugs or problems as we did in the teaching lesson, as we had more experince with the topic. Some problems we ran into this project was thing such as our timline, our NPC was glitching due to wrong animation features, and small bugs here and there such as typos and tiny bugs. Our key accomplishments were mainly things such as meeting all the requirments and ensuring that everyone in the team had something to do, which we did better than the last project. We succesfully managed to have a working NPC with interaction, movement, a new background.
